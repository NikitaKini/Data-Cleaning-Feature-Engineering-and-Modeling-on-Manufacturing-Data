# Data Cleaning Feature Engineering and Modeling on Manufacturing Data

This is a code for a fully automated data analysing tool as a part of Industry 4.0 project with Python and MongoDB.
- The activity includes the creation of a Python program for workpiece-specific data acquisition from multiple sources, ie, DAS Server, IOTGateway, and MongoDB.
- It further includes data cleaning, processing and storage of high-frequency manufacturing data.
- Statistical features are extracted from the cleaned data which is fed into the ML model to achieve predictions of workpiece quality based on the manufacturing data.
- A GUI with Python TkInter is finally programmed for the visualization of the real-time quality predictions.
